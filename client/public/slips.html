            <h3 class="display-4">Slips Review:</h3>
            <p id="about-slips">A slip is defined as a person intending to do the appropriate action, but instead ending up doing something else. Norman describes this as follows: "when the action performed is not the same as the action that was intended," (171). There are two further classifications of slips:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Action-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. This can mean performing the wrong action on the correct object, or performing the correct action on the wrong object. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Memory-Lapse</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In memory-lapse slips, the intended action is not done, or simply forgotten about, usually due to an interruption between the time an action is decided upon and the time it is complete.</p>
                </li>
            </ul> <!-- end of list group -->
            <hr />
            <p>Action slips can further be divided into three categories:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Capture slips</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Capture slips are when you are intending to do an action, and instead a more familiar action occurs; it captures the action.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Description-similarity slips</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In description-similarity slips, an item similar to the target item is acted upon.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Mode error</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Mode error slips occur when the controls of an object mean different things in different modes.</p>
                </li>
            </ul> <!-- end of list group -->
            <hr />
            <h5>Examples and How to Avoid:</h5>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Capture slips</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Examples of capture slips would be counting, "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King" when you just meant to count normally, and may occur if you have recently been playing cards. In UX/UI, it usually happens with sequences that start the same, and then diverge. These sequences should be designed different from the start!</p>
                    <p class="mb-1">Designers need to avoid sequences that start identically, and then diverge at a point, because people will be used to the familiar and slip when it diverges.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Description-similarity slips</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">A description-similarity slip could be throwing your dirty laundry in the toilet instead of the laundry basket. They are both reasonably-sized containers, but they have significantly different uses! In designing, you want to make sure that different controls have completely different feels to them, so no error is made. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">Designers should ensure that controls that do different things have a completely different look and feel from one another, otherwise people will see them as similar and mix them up.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Mode error</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Mode error would be typing a sentence in caps lock when you meant to type it normally, or setting your alarm clock to 7PM instead of 7AM. In design, there have been ferry accidents and plane accidents because the controls were not in the right mode, and the pilot thought they were. This is very common.</p>
                    <p class="mb-1">Whenever possible, avoid having modes in design. It may be more cost effective, but it could cost many lives in the long run to have the same set of controls do different things depending on the mode the controls are in.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Memory-lapse slips</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Memory-lapse slips can be anything such as forgetting to set your alarm clock the night before you need to wake up, or a new mom forgetting her child somewhere. In critical situations, this can be forgetting to do a required check or test on an object that then results in total failure</p>
                    <p class="mb-1">People need constant reminders of the task they were doing, specifically because people are interrupted constantly. Always assume your users will be interrupted and will need assistance in finding where to pick back up.</p>
