            <h3 class="display-4">Mistakes Review:</h3>
            <p id="about-mistakes">A mistake is when a person establishes the wrong goal or plan of action, and therefore any actions that follow are also wrong even if executed properly, since they are part of the wrong plan. Mistakes have three sub-classifications, which are described as follows: </p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Rule-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In rule-based mistakes, the situation may be misinterpreted, leading one to follow an inappropriate rule, or the correct rule is invoked, but the rule is flawed because it was improperly formulated or the conditions are different, or the correct rule is invoked but the outcome is incorrectly evaluated.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Knowledge-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In knowledge-based mistakes, errors happen because the situation is new enough that there are no skills or rules to cover it, so a new procedure must be devised. Knowledge-based behavior occurs at the reflective level and is slow and conscious.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Memory-Lapse</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In memory-lapse mistakes, there is forgetting at the stages of planning or evaluation, often due to interruption or information not being continuously available.</p>
                </li>

            <h3 class="mb-1">Examples and How to Avoid:</h3>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Rule-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Ex: A driver who is unaccustomed to anti-lock brakes may see an object in the road on a wet, rainy day. They apply full force to the breaks, but the car skids, triggering the anti-lock brakes to turn the brakes on and off. When the driver feels vibrations, he takes his foot off the brakes, thinking they are malfunctioning, but the vibrations are a sign that the brakes are working properly. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">How to avoid: The challenge in designing to prevent rule-based mistakes is to present all the information about the state of the system in a way that is easy to interpret and understand, while providing alternate explanations and interpretations.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Knowledge-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Ex: In the Boeing 767 emergency landing, a knowledge-based mistake may have been computing the fuel in pounds instead of kilograms, because the person who did it was used to pounds.</p>
                    <p class="mb-1">How to avoid: Have a good instruction manual for novel objects, but be careful not to overload the user with unnecessary information, because they may get confused and overwhelmed.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Memory-Lapse</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Ex: In the Boeing 767 emergency landing, a memory-lapse mistake could have been forgetting to inspect the plane before takeoff, due to interruption.</p>
                    <p class="mb-1">How to avoid: Assume your user will be continuously interrupted during the use of the object and may need assistance in resuming the operation.</p>
