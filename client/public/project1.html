            <p class="about">Norman defines error as "any deviance from 'appropriate' behavior," (170), where here, appropriate references the intended or correct behavior in that situation. Because hindsight is 20/20, it is often sometimes hard to know what the 'appropriate' action is in the moment, but in the aftermath it seems quite obvious. Errors are different from deliberate violations of protocol/rules, and this page focuses on human error rather than deliberate violations. The two major classifications of errors, according to Don Norman, are slips and mistakes, described below.</p>

            <h3 class="display-4">Slips:</h3>
            <p id="about-slips">A slip is defined as a person intending to do the appropriate action, but instead ending up doing something else. Norman describes this as follows: "when the action performed is not the same as the action that was intended," (171). There are two further classifications of slips:</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Action-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. This can mean performing the wrong action on the correct object, or performing the correct action on the wrong object. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Memory-Lapse</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In memory-lapse slips, the intended action is not done, or simply forgotten about, usually due to an interruption between the time an action is decided upon and the time it is complete.</p>

            <h3 class="display-4">Mistakes:</h3>
            <p id="about-mistakes">A mistake is when a person establishes the wrong goal or plan of action, and therefore any actions that follow are also wrong even if executed properly, since they are part of the wrong plan. Mistakes have three sub-classifications, which are described as follows: </p>

                <li class="list-group-item">

                    <p class="mb-1">In rule-based mistakes, the situation is appropriately diagnosed, but the user has decided on the wrong course of action due to the wrong rule being followed.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Knowledge-Based</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">In knowledge-based mistakes, the problem is misdiagnosed because of erroneous or incomplete knowledge.</p>

                    <p class="mb-1">In memory-lapse mistakes, there is forgetting at the stages of planning or evaluation, often due to interruption or information not being continuously available.</p>

            <h3>Levels of Processing:</h3>
            <p>Before jumping further into slips and mistakes, I want to introduce the concept of the three levels of emotional processing, which will be instrumental in understanding how and when slips and mistakes occur.</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Reflective</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">This level of processing usually is combined with a deep level of understanding. It can encompass how the meaning of a product, or the impact the experience had on them. Sometimes generalized down to praise/satisfaction or blame.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Behavioral</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Behavioral processing comes with learned skills and often is used to determine how well the product functioned, how effective it was, and ease of use.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Visceral</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Visceral processing is quick, 'fight or flight' reactions based on whether the experience was good or bad, how it made you feel, and any initial impressions.</p>

            <h3>The Action Cycle:</h3>
            <p>These different levels of processing occur in seven different stages of the action cycle, pictured to the left. The three stages on the left are known as the Gulf of Execution and the three on the right are known as the Gulf of Evaluation. The goal comes before any execution and after all evaluation.</p>

            <h3>Where Slips and Mistakes Originate in the Action Cycle:</h3>
            <p>The leftmost figure (Figure A) shows that action slips originate in the bottom four stages of the action cycle (the behavioral and visceral layers) during the execution of a plan or in the interpretation/perception of the outcome of an action, while mistakes come from the top three stages (the reflective stages) where the goal or plan is set, or the outcome is compared to the original goal. <br /> Meanwhile the figure on the right side of the diagram (Figure B) illustrates that memory lapses impact transitions between stages (noted by the X's), with lapses at the higher levels leading to mistakes, and lapses at the lower levels leading to slips. This can usually be attributed to interruption, and then a lack of accessible information on how to continue from where the user left off.</p>
